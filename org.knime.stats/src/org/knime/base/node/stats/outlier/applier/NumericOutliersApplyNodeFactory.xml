	<shortDescription>
		Handles outliers for all numerical columns according to the provided model.

		<intro>
			 <p>
        	This node treats outliers in the input data according to the parameters
        	of the model input (typically coming from the Numeric Outliers node). It
        	detects and treats the outliers of all columns in the input data that are
        	also contained in the model input. The detection of the outliers in the
        	input data relies soley on the rules learned by the model.
        	</p>
        	<p>
        	Note that all observations belonging to groups not seen by the model
        	will be considered non-outliers. Furthermore, no domain updated will
        	be performed if this node is executed in streaming-mode.

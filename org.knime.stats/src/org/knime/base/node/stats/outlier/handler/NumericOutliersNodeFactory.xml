	<name>Numeric Outliers</name>
	<shortDescription>
		Detects and handles outliers for all numerical columns.
	</shortDescription>

	<fullDescription>
		<intro>
			<p>
				This node detects and treats the outliers for each of the selected columns
				individually by means of
				<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outlier#Tukey's_fences">interquartile range (IQR)</a>.
			</p>
			<p>
				To detect the outliers for a given column, the first and
				third
				quartile (Q<sub>1</sub>, Q<sub>3</sub>) is computed.
				An observation is flagged an outlier if it lies
				outside the range
				R = [Q<sub>1</sub> - k(IQR), Q<sub>3</sub> + k(IQR)] with
				IQR = Q<sub>3</sub> - Q<sub>1</sub>	and k &gt;= 0.
				Setting k = 1.5 the smallest value in R corresponds,
				typically, to the lower end of a boxplot's whisker and largest value
				to its upper end.
				<br />
				Providing grouping information allows to detect outliers only
				within their respective groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				If an observation is flagged an outlier, one can either replace it by 
				some other value or remove/retain the corresponding row.
			</p>
			<p>
				Missing values contained in the data will be ignored, i.e., they
				will neither be used for the outlier computation nor will they be
				flagged as an outlier.
			</p>
		</intro>
		<tab name="Outlier Selection">
			<option name="Outlier selection">
				Allows the selection of columns for which outliers have to be
				detected
				and treated. If "Compute outlier statistics on groups" (see tab "Group Settings") is selected,
				the outliers for each of the columns are computed solely with respect
				to the different groups.
			</option>

		</tab>
		
		<tab name="General Settings">
			<option name="interquartile range multiplier (k)">
				Allows scaling the interquartile range (IQR).
				The default is k = 1.5. Larger values will cause less values to be considered outliers.
			</option>
			
			<option name="Quartile calculation">
				Allows to specify how the quartiles are computed.
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Use heuristic (memory friendly):</b>
						This option ensure that the quartiles are calculated
						using a heuristical approach. This choice is recommended
						for large data sets due to its low memory requirements.
						However, for small data sets the results of this approach
						can be quite far away from the accurate results.  
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Full data estimate using:</b>
						This option typically creates more accurate results than
						its counterpart, but also requires far more additional
						memory. Therefore, we recommend this option for smaller
						data sets. 
						<br/>
						Since the value of the quartiles often lies between
						two observations, this option additionally allows to specify
						how the actual value is computed, which is encoded by the various 
						estimation types (LEGACY, R_1, ..., R_9). A detailed explanation of 
						the different types can be found 
						<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantile#Estimating_quantiles_from_a_sample"> 
						here</a>.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Update domain">
				If checked the domain of the selected outlier columns
				is updated.
			</option>

		</tab>

		<tab name="Outlier Treatment">

			<option name="Apply to">
				Allows to apply the selected treatment strategy to
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>All outliers</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Outliers below lower bound</b>
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Outliers above upper bound</b>
					</li>
				</ul> 
			</option>
			
			<option name="Treatment option">
				Defines three different strategies to treat outliers:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Replace outlier values:</b>
						Allows to replace outliers based on the selected "Replacement
						strategy"
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Remove outlier rows:</b>
						Removes all rows from the input data that contain in any of the
						selected columns at least one outlier
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Remove non-outlier rows:</b>
						Retains only those rows of the input data that contain at
						least one outlier in any of the selected columns
					</li>

				</ul>
			</option>

			<option name="Replacement strategy ">
				Defines two different strategies to replace outliers:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Missing values:</b>
						Replaces every outlier by a missing value
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Closest permitted value:</b>
						Replaces the value of each outlier by the closest value within the
						permitted interval R. If the column type is an integer the
						replacement value is the closest integer within the permitted interval.
					</li>
				</ul>
				Note that this option is only enabled if outliers have to be replaced.
			</option>

		</tab>
		
		<tab name="Group Selection">
			<option name="Compute outlier statistics on groups">
				If selected, allows the selection of columns to identify groups. A group comprises all
				rows of the input exhibiting the same values in every single column (similar to the GroupBy node).
				The outliers will finally be computed with respect to each of the
				individual groups.
			</option>
			<option name="Column Filter">
			     Move the columns defining the groups into the Include list. The group definition will take priority,
			     i.e. if a column is selected for both group definition and outlier handling, 
			     it will be used to define groups (no outlier handling done for that column). 
			</option>

		</tab>
		<tab name="Memory Policy">
			<option name="Process groups in memory">
				Processes the groups in the memory. This option comes with higher
				memory requirements, but is faster since the table does not 
				need any additional treatment.
			</option>

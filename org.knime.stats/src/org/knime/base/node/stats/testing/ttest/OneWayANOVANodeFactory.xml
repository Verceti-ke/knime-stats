    <shortDescription>
        The one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) allows to test if any of several means are different from each other.

    <fullDescription>
        <intro>Computes statistics for the one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). 
        It is designed 
        to compare the means of observations in the same column between 
        several groups. The node allows the testing of equality of variances 
        (Levene's test) and the t-value for both equal- and unequal-variance. 
        It also provides the relevant descriptive statistics.</intro>

        <option name="Confidence Interval (in %)">
	    The limits for the confidence interval are computed using this number. The
	    default is 95 which means that you can be 95% confident that the true value 
	    of the parameter is in the confidence interval.

        <option name="Test columns">
        A two sample t-test is performed separately for each of these columns.

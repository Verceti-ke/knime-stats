        <intro>
            The Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test checks whether a sample comes from a normally distributed population. It is applicable for 3 to 5000 data points.
            The node outputs two values: the test statistic W and the corresponding p-value. To accept or reject the null hypothesis, one can either compare W
            to a predefined threshold Wcritical or use a threshold for the p-value.
            Since the test is biased by sample size, the test may be statistically significant from a normal distribution in any large samples.
            Thus a Q–Q plot is required for verification in addition to the test.
            More information about this test can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro–Wilk_test">Wikipedia</a>.

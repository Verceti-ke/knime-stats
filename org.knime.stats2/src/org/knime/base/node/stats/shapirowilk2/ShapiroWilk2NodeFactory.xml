        <intro>
            The Shapiro-Wilk Normality Test checks if a sample comes from a normally distributed population. It is applicable for 3 to 5000 data points.
            The node outputs two values: the test statistic <i>W</i> and the corresponding <i>p</i>-value. To test if the null hypothesis (H<sub>0</sub>: sample comes from a normally distributed population)
            can be rejected or not, the significance level &#945; is compared with the calculated <i>p</i>-value.
            Since the test is biased by sample size, the test may be statistically significant from a normal distribution in any large sample.
            More information about this test can be found on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiroâ€“Wilk_test">Wikipedia</a>.

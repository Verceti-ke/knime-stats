		<intro>
			Calculates the Wilcoxon signed-rank statistics for dependent
			groups. The static
			w is calculated by building the difference between
			the two values of
			a pair and ranking them. The output will be the sum
			of ranks of positive
			differences (w+) and the sum of ranks of negative
			differences (w-) and
			the measures derived from that.

		<option name="Left column - Right column">
			You can define the test column pairs here. Every
			pair is used to perform a Wilcoxon signed-rank test separately.
